# **School_District_Analysis**

## **Purpose**
The analysis utilising Python, Pandas, and Jupyter notebook aims to scrutinise the extent of dishonesty and summarise the overall schools performance. The initial practice analysis showed that the data for Thomas High School, 9th graders, were tempered. After removing the Mathematics and Reading scores of Thomas School, the analysis was performed again to see the difference in the data compared to the practice module.

## **Analysis of the results**

- The district summary was affected by the altered data of the 9th grade of Thomas High School. The particular data was removed, and the analysis was performed again. The overall passing percentage score was dropped to 64.9%. The district-level summary data now looks like below.

- The effect on St. Thomas High School is marginal. The overall passing score also plummeted to 65%. The school still holds the second place in top five perfoming scholls list.

- It looks at the data based on the Maths and Reading score, nullifying St. Thomas High School's data from the overall set had a marginal effect.


## **Summary**

The effect of nullifying the Math and Reading data of the 9th graders from St. Thomas Schools are as follow:
  - The overall passing score of all the schools was in decline.
  - The passing percentage of St. Thomas school was also decreased.
  - The district-level rank of top performers does not include St. Thomas High school anymore.
  - The effect at the top five performing list was not significant since St. Thomas still holds second place.
